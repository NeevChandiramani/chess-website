                <h2>Rules of Chess</h2>
                <p>Chess is a two-player strategy game played on a checkered gameboard called a chessboard. The objective is to checkmate your opponent's king, putting it into a position where it is in check and there is no legal move to escape.</p>
                <h3>Basic Setup</h3>
                <p>The game is played on an 8x8 grid, with alternating black and white squares. Each player starts with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. Here's how the pieces are arranged:</p>

                <h3>Movement of Pieces</h3>
                <p>Each type of chess piece has its own unique way of moving across the board. Here's a brief overview:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>King:</strong> Can move one square in any direction.</li>
                    <li><strong>Queen:</strong> Can move any number of squares diagonally, horizontally, or vertically.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rook:</strong> Can move any number of squares horizontally or vertically.</li>
                    <li><strong>Knight:</strong> Moves in an L-shape, two squares in one direction and then one square perpendicular.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bishop:</strong> Can move any number of squares diagonally.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pawn:</strong> Moves forward one square, but captures diagonally.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Checkmate</h3>
                <p>The game ends when one player's king is in a position to be captured (in check) and there is no legal move to escape (checkmate).</p>
                <p>Here's a video explaining the rules in detail:</p>
